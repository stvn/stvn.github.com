      I started using <a href="http://www.emberjs.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">ember.js</a> for a couple different projects recently and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it.  On one hand, it's AWESOME!  On the other hand, it seems needlessly complicated and is such a paradigm shift from traditional front-end development that it makes it difficult to get anything done (the first time).

      Documentation
    </p>

    <p>
      The ember team does a great job getting documentation onto the website, however, it doesn't seem to be structured in a way that makes it easy to find information.  Sure, at first glance it looks wonderful!  But, as soon as you get past the most basic of examples and into the meat of a real application, the details go sparse.  I've had to rely heavily on google and links to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=emberjs" target="blank" class="inline-link">stackoverflow</a>.  I'll except this is due to the framework's heavily opiniated ways (which I like btw).

    <p class="section-title">
      Templating
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of the box, ember uses <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">handlebars.js</a> for templating.  This is great, because I LOVE handlebars!  What's not great, is that it seems to disrupt everything I thought I knew about handlebars.  You can't just go write a handlebar helper like you used to.  Now, you need to know that ember passes a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12184696/handlebars-helpers-in-ember-js" target="_blank" class="inline-link">context variable that must be interrogated within the helper</a>. Oh, yes, it is easy -- once you know there is this a context!
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">
      Boilerplate
    </p>

    <p>
      The advantage of ember over other frameworks is that it's supposed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code to handle tasks that are common across most (if not all) applications.  In this regard, ember does an excellent job.  Once you get the framework up and running and have your <strong>V</strong> plugged into your <strong>C</strong> and your <strong>C</strong> plugged into your <strong>M</strong>, buidling out an applicaiton becomes relatively simple and separation of responsibility is barely a consideration for the developer.

      Overall
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I don't hate it.  I think I actually like it.  I'm going to keep plugging away on it and see how it goes.  Who knows, it might just be me that's needlessly complicated.
