      I started using <a href="http://www.emberjs.com" target="_blank" class="inline-link">ember.js</a> for a couple different projects recently and I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it.  On one hand, it's AWESOME!  On the other hand, it seems needlessly complicated and is such a paradigm shift from traditional front-end development that it makes it difficult to get anything done (the first time).
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">
      Documentation
    </p>

    <p>
      The ember team does a great job getting documentation onto the website, however, it doesn't seem to be structured in a way that makes it easy to find information.  Sure, at first glance it looks wonderful!  But, as soon as you get past the most basic of examples and into the meat of a real application, the details go sparse.  I've had to rely heavily on google and links to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=emberjs" target="blank" class="inline-link">stackoverflow</a>.  I'll accept this is due to the framework's heavily opiniated ways (which I like btw).
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">
      Templating
    </p>

    <p>
      Out of the box, ember uses <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">handlebars.js</a> for templating.  This is great, because I LOVE handlebars!  What's not great, is that it seems to disrupt everything I thought I knew about handlebars.  You can't just go write a handlebar helper like you used to.  Now, you need to know that ember passes a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12184696/handlebars-helpers-in-ember-js" target="_blank" class="inline-link">context variable that must be interrogated within the helper</a>. Oh, yes, it is easy -- once you know there is this a context!
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">
      Boilerplate
    </p>

    <p>
      The advantage of ember over other frameworks is that it's supposed to reduce the amount of boilerplate code to handle tasks that are common across most (if not all) applications.  In this regard, ember does an excellent job.  Once you get the framework up and running and have your <strong>V</strong> plugged into your <strong>C</strong> and your <strong>C</strong> plugged into your <strong>M</strong>, buidling out an applicaiton becomes relatively simple and separation of responsibility is barely a consideration for the developer.
    </p>

    <p class="section-title">
      Overall
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I don't hate it.  I think I actually like it.  I'm going to keep plugging away on it and see how it goes.  Who knows, it might just be me that's needlessly complicated.

      <strong>Fun with jekyll and and github pages!</strong>
    </p>
      <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">Jekyll</a> is a static content authoring tool, that when used with <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" class="inline-link">github pages</a>, makes it dead simple (and sexy) to create a blog.
    <p>

    <p>
      Just getting set up and trying to figure out what this bad boy can do.  So far it's been really easy to get going.  I initialially started out using <a href="https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap" class="inline-link" target="_blank">jekyll bootstrap</a>, however, I quickly tired trying to make it look less twitter-bootstrap-like.  Instead, I ripped everthing out and started from scratch.  Ulitmately, I'm pretty happy with the result.  I wanted something simple and functional, and in the end, I think that's what I ended up with.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's been over 5 years since last maintaining a blog. I often find myself thinking about starting  to do it again and then life distracts me.  So, today I got up and decided not to be distracted.  And now, I write...
